# JMeter Section

# Note: Add the hostname or IP of the node you wish to be the JMeter Master node. Master nodes control the slave nodes.
# There needs to be ONLY one master per test run. *Change the host name or IP of the master node here.*
# If you want to run this on the master node then set the hostname or IP below but then change the playbook
# 'install-jmeter-master.yml' hosts section to say localhost instead of jmeter-master-node. The reason for this is
# because 'jmeter-master-node' value below is also used in other playbooks that need the correct host name or IP.

# Note: You can have as many slave nodes as required for the given test.
# There MUST be at least one (can be the same as the Master). Add as many slave host names or IPs as needed.
# NOTE: For now, manually add the slave nodes below into the variable in jmeter_slave_nodes in the cluster specific
# file. For example, for the cluster iqs-beta the file will be in group_vars/iqs01
