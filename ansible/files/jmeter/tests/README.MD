## Directory of your specific test

Whatever name you give a test dirctory under files/jmeter/test it goes here like the example one called beta_rgw. ALL files you put in the specific test directory that does not end in .jmx or .sh will be copied to ALL Slave JMeter servers. Any .jmx or .sh files found in the test directory will be put into the Master.
